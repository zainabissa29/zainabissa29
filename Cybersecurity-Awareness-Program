# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Awareness & Social Engineering Resilience Program


---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository demonstrates a full end-to-end **Cybersecurity Awareness & Social Engineering Resilience Program** — from survey and needs assessment through program design, training rollout, and performance reporting.

The project was designed to simulate how a cybersecurity analyst develops and manages an **enterprise-wide awareness initiative**, tailored especially for organizations in **Operational Technology (OT) and SCADA environments**.

> 🧩 *Goal:* Build a measurable, data-driven awareness culture that reduces phishing risk, strengthens security behavior, and supports compliance with NIST SP 800-50 and ISO 27001 controls.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Assess organizational awareness maturity through baseline surveys  
- Develop policies, communication plans, and stakeholder engagement materials  
- Conduct targeted phishing simulations and hands-on awareness training  
- Measure success using key performance indicators (KPIs) and dashboards  
- Continuously improve program design through quarterly review cycles

## 🚀 Implementation Workflow

### **Phase 1 — Survey & Assessment**
- Launch baseline awareness survey (social engineering focus)
- Identify high-risk user groups and training needs

### **Phase 2 — Program Design**
- Draft Cybersecurity Awareness Policy  
- Conduct stakeholder meetings for policy buy-in  
- Create communication strategy for rollout  

### **Phase 3 — Training & Implementation**
- Deploy phishing simulation campaigns  
- Roll out themed awareness posters and short videos  
- Conduct email security and password hygiene sessions

### **Phase 4 — Metrics & Reporting**
- Analyze results using Power BI and Excel dashboards  
- Track report rates, click rates, and completion metrics

### **Phase 5 — Continuous Improvement**
- Conduct quarterly KPI reviews  
- Gather feedback and align with NIST/ISO frameworks  
- Update training content based on emerging threats

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| KPI | Formula | Target |
|-----|----------|---------|
| **Phishing Click Rate** | (Clicked ÷ Sent) × 100 | ≤ 10% |
| **Report Rate** | (Reported ÷ Sent) × 100 | ≥ 60% |
| **Training Completion Rate** | (Completed ÷ Assigned) × 100 | ≥ 95% |
| **Resilience Score** | (Report Rate – Click Rate) | ≥ 50% |

📈 *Example Result:*  
> Phishing incidents reduced by **60%**, and reporting rates increased by **45%** within six months.

## 📈 Lessons Learned

- Behavioral change requires both awareness **and reinforcement**  
- Metrics drive management support — visibility = funding  
- Gamification and real-world phishing samples increase engagement  
- Department-specific training yields better long-term results  

---

## 🧩 Future Enhancements

- Integrate **mobile security and smishing simulations**  
- Automate KPI dashboards through Power BI refresh schedules  
- Expand phishing simulations to include **vishing** (voice-based) scenarios  
- Conduct annual awareness certification for all employees
